## usage
This is a basic day planner app that loops through the hours of 9am - 5pm for a specific date, today. The app uses moment.js to handle time. The app allows the user to enter and save text into any description field that has a class of future. The data will be saved to the localStorage of the browser. The past hours are highlighted gray, the current hour red, and future hours green.
